        <h2>Short Biography</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            My name is Jacob Ambrose, and I am originally from Lubbock, TX. In 2016 I initially earned a 
            Bachelor's in International Business. Since then I have moved from Texas to California and am now currently in North Carolina.
        </p>
        <p>Post-graduation in 2016 I began working full-time in the summer camp and outdoor education industry. As a Project Coordinator I moved from Texas to Running Springs, California.
            I met my future spouse there and in 2018 we both moved back to her home state of North Carolina. 
        </p>
        <p>After moving to North Carolina, I continued my career in the outdoor education industry, but in 2021 decided to pursue other ventures. 
            In 2021 I moved to working for Lowes Corporate as a Project Coordinator of their home installations. I have currently been there coming up on 3 years now.
        </p>
        <p>Now living in North Carolina my wife and I, and our two dogs like to pursue a variety of hobbies.
            <span class="sentence">Whether we are camping or hiking, or reading in our backyard we are having a blast.</span>
            I am looking forward to seeing what the future continues to hold!
